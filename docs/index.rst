Welcome to SimOS's documentation!
===============================

Welcome to the documentation of SimOS - SIMulation of Optically adressable Spins. 

SimOS is a library for the simulation of spin systems in Python.  Although the simulation of optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) experiments is our main focus, SimOS is also suitable for simulations of conventional NMR and EPR experiments. 
If your research is focused on quantum optics, you might use this library as an extension to qutips quantum optics resources. 

To get started, you can either install SimOS following our :ref:`instructions <Installation>` or explore SimOS without any installation in our :ref:`Virtual Lab <Installation>`.
